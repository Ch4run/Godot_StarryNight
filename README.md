# Godot_StarryNight
Godot 4.3 fun 2d project, GDScript; populates the screen with sprites + extras 

As a newbie in Godot, I set up a test project to try some ideas getting familiar with the engine and GDScript
	- 2d scene in full hd(1920*1080) screen size
	- spawning objects(star sprites) with random sizes and positions
	- waiting time between spawner iterations
	- space key input(input map action settings) -> makes a screenshot render from script
